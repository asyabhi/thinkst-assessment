<p id="description">This project automates the Conduit app using Playwright and TypeScript</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

- This automation framework is designed with the Page Object Model. By default all the tests will be run in three browsers Chromium(Chrome Based Browser) Firefox Webkit(Safari).
- If you want to run the tests on a specific browser you can use the flag "--project=BROWSER_NAME" along with npm test. For example npm test --project=chromium
- To toggle between headed and headless execution use the flag "--headed". This will turn on headed execution of the tests.
